# Stereo image with semi global matching 

Semi-Global Matching (SGM) is a commonly used algorithm in stereo vision (Stereo Matching). Proposed by Hirschmüller in 2005, it strikes a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, and is widely applied in depth estimation and 3D reconstruction.
